# Progressmate

Make the HTML5 progress element look hot across different browsers with jQuery.progressmate and Raphaël.

This is similar to another plugin I've put together, [jQuery.ratemate](https://github.com/DylanFM/jquery.ratemate), for star ratings using HTML5 input elements and the meter element.

This plugin is being developed in CoffeeScript. Grab the compiled jQuery plugin from src/compiled/.

## Requirements

Progressmate is being developed using jQuery 1.4.4 and Raphaël 1.5.2. These libraries can be found via their websites or in the lib/ directory of this project.
